Iâ€™m currently an MSc student from the Computer Vision and Robotics Laboratory ([VeRLab](https://www.verlab.dcc.ufmg.br/)) at the Department of Computer Science ([DCC](https://www.dcc.ufmg.br/)) of the Federal University of Minas Gerais ([UFMG](https://ufmg.br/)) in Brazil. I graduated in Automation and Control Engineering (Diploma - 5 years) at the same university (2023). During graduation I worked with VANTs (drones), multi-robots systems, robots cooperation, routing problems, path planning and evolutionary algorithms.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
