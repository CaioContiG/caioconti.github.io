With other postgraduates students, we are using Reinforcement Learning to solve an human-machine interaction problem. The problem consists in developing a technique to move a robot to reach a group of humans without being intrusive, respecting social rules. main ideia is using RL o move a robot to reach a group of humans without being intrusive, respecting social rules. My contribution was to adapt the modelled problem to work using RL with SARSA and Q-Learning and we have been recently testing with Neural Networks. Project is still in progress.
