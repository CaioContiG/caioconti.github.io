With other postgraduates students, we used Reinforcement Learning to navigate a robot to a socially-acceptable point in a group of people while avoiding obstacles. My contribution was to adapt the problem of social-approach to be solved using RL with SARSA and Q-Learning. This project is on hold at the moment.
