## Ingredients

- 210g cheese of your choice (parmesan, canastra, meia-cura, or a mix like queijo minas + parmesan)

## Preparation  

### Preparing the Dough  
1. **Mix the Egg**: Beat the egg lightly in a small bowl.  
2. **Chop the Chives**: Finely chop the chives, or adjust the size to your preference.  
3. **Preheat the Oven**: Set your oven to 220°C and allow it to preheat while you prepare the dough.  
4. **Combine Dry Ingredients**: In a large bowl, add polvilho, cheese, and salt. Mix thoroughly.  
5. **Add Butter and Egg**: Add the butter and beaten egg to the dry mixture.  
   - The butter should ideally be cold.  
   - Mix until the butter breaks into small pieces, forming a crumbly texture similar to coarse sand or thick farofa.  
6. **Incorporate Chives**: Add chives in small portions, mixing until you achieve the desired amount and distribution.  
7. **Adjust with Milk**: Gradually add milk in small portions, mixing after each addition.  
   - The dough should be moldable but slightly crumbly.  
   - If too dry and sandy, add more milk. If too wet, add more polvilho.  
8. **Final Texture**: The dough should come together into a large ball without sticking to your hands.

### Shaping the Biscuits  
1. **Shape the Dough**: Grab pieces of the dough and form into cylinder-shaped biscuits, about 4–7 cm in length with rounded edges.  
2. **Prepare the Baking Pan**:  
   - No greasing or parchment paper is necessary as the polvilho prevents sticking.  
   - However, using parchment paper may result in more evenly cooked biscuits (optional).  
3. **Optional Freezing Step**:  
   - Freeze the shaped biscuits for 5 minutes before transferring to a ziplock bag for storage in the freezer.  
   - Alternatively, bake directly after shaping.

## Baking the Biscuits  
1. **Preheat Reminder**: Ensure your oven has preheated for at least 15 minutes, for my oven is around 20-25.  
2. **Bake**: Place the biscuits on the baking pan.  
   - No need to space them far apart, as they do not expand significantly during baking.  
   - Bake for around 20 minutes (fresh) or up to 40 minutes (frozen).  
3. **Check for Doneness**: The biscuits are ready when the tops turn a light golden color.

### Extra observations: 
Chives are just one flavor option! Consider, Leeks, Garlic, Pimenta calabresa, Chili flakes. 
- **Chives:** My favorite! They add a fresh, mild onion-like flavor.  
- **Leeks:** A good alternative, but you'll need more than what you would put for chives to get the taste.
- **Pimenta calabresa:** good, but spicy!
